# Towers-Of-Hanoi

The game is the following:
1. You have three towers, with n disks on the original tower
2. Your goal is to move all the disks to the destination tower, using the auxiliary tower.
3. A move consists of moving one disk from a tower to another, such that no bigger disk
	is on top of a smaller disk
  
Given the name of the three towers and the number of disks, the program will return a list of tuples indicating the moves needed to solve the problem.
