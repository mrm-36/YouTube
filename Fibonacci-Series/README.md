# Fibonacci-Series

1. Definition
	The fibonacci series is defined as 
  current number = the sum of the previous two numbers 
  and the first nb = 0, the second nb = 1
	Formally, 
	f(0) = 0
	f(1) = 1
	f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

The fibonacci series can be solved in multiple ways.

1. Iterative Method
	For the iterative method, we need to keep track of three variables:
	the current number and the previous two numbers.

2. The Recursive Method
	This method uses the definition of the fibonacci series
	The base cases here are f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1
	and the recursive step is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
